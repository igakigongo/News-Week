## Introduction
Trying out Twitter’s Bootstrap framework by building a site that actually uses it – Newsweek.

#### Specific Tasks
* Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.
* Add Bootstrap to your project by following the instructions at GetBootstrap.com. Use the examples on that page as templates for how to organize your page.
* Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and which are positioned by using the appropriate Bootstrap classes.
* Set up the top title and navigation bar.
* Work your way down the page by filling in and positioning the additional sections.
* Try resizing the browser to see if it mimics the behavior of the real Newsweek homepage.
